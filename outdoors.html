<h1>Outdoors</h1>
<h2>Ah, the great outdoors.  There's nothing like moving to North Carolina from San Diego and basically feeling like you're walking around in a thinner level of the ocean, which is just aerated enough to allow you to breath.  I love to fish, camp, hike, bike, etc, etc.  I'll be adding posts here as I find new places on the East Side. </h2>
