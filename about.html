<h1>Dan Shumate</h1>
<h2>Honestly, I didn't even realize I was a millenial util I had become successful in my career.  I never had an affinity for skinny jeans, and I promptly moved out after high school.  I currently manage an East Coast location of the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy, which I went through myself a couple years ago.  I actually manage a different learning path than the one I went through, which has lead to my personal interest and passion for coding.  </h2>
